Player Software Version 4

This is the software that comes with the network music players/streamers sold by Retro Audiophile Designs. The products are old vintage radios or sometimes cassette decks where new electronics have been retrofitted. To learn more about the products visit our web site: www.retroaudiophiledesigns.com

The software makes it possible to stream music using Bluetooth, Spotify, Airplay or UPnP. In addition, it can play music files from an attached USB flash memory stick. It connects the hardware to Bluetooth (as a sink) and it is also possible to connect to home networks with cable or Wi-Fi. It is even possible to connect to Bluetooth speaker systems or Bluetooth headphones (as a renderer) and in addition also the designated hardware set up can be connected to old fashioned wired passive Hi-Fi speakers. The system and its connections are managed by a web interface. There is also a playback web interface for playing music files.
